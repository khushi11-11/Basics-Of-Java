//    when setting a large integer or something, instead of commas(,) we seperate it with underscores(_)
//    int a = 234_000_000; same as 234M / 234,000,000
//    the compiler automatically replaces these underscores with commas, but is not comfortable with directly putting commas within

//    Integer here is a class, the benefit is that many fxns can be used on rno now
